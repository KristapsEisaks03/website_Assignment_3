            <div style="color:black;">
                Vive Pro is an upgrade from the original Vive headset. It comes with built in headphones which provided much better quality of sound and uses newest 2.0 Base stations which come with improvement in FOV and with higher accuracy.<br><br>
                Comfort has also been upgraded so overall it is a high budget and premium headset but issue that is with this headset is the upgrade comparing to old HTC vive are little and looking by the price of around £800 or even £1000 and looking by upgrades and the price it is more worth it of buying old HTC Vive (Unless you want 2.0 Base Stations).<br>

        <div class="FlexBox_Property">
            <div>
                HTC Vive Cosmos is the first headset from HTC that does not uses external lighthouses but uses inside out tracking meaning every movement and location is tracking by the headset itself using cameras on the outside of the headset.<br>
                But controllers that are with Cosmos are quite bulky and also are tracked using light which is not ideal meaning you would have lower precision of tracking comparing to Oculus. At launch it had issues with tracking in way that you could not 
                play games normally which destroyed the experience but after a year they have completely fixed the issue but it has no way of tracking your hands behind as there is no AI that does that for you like in Oculus.<br>
                Price of the headset is around £699 which is quite expensive.
